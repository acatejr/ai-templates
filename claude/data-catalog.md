## Problem Statement
**What specific problem are you trying to solve?**
I need to build an application that serves as a data catalog and data inventory system.
I'd like to levarage an LLM and features like RAG in the data catdalog.

**Problem Type:** [Check one or more]
- [x] Technical/System issue
- [ ] Process/Workflow problem  
- [ ] Team/People challenge
- [ ] Strategic/Business decision
- [ ] Resource/Budget constraint
- [ ] Timeline/Deadline pressure
- [ ] Other: _______________

## Context & Background
**Current Situation:**
Currently I have writtne python scripts that harvest metadata from three sources within the organization I am doing the work for.  The harvested metadata is stored as a jason file with a list of document objects and each document object has a title field, description field, a keywords list and will have other fields later.

**How did this problem arise?**
The organization identified that there are problems when it comes to employees not being able to find data for their work, know the history and origins of the data or just general information about the data.

**Who/what is affected?**
The stakeholders are both internal employees and the general public.  Some of the data will be public, but not all and some will be private.

## Constraints & Parameters
**Timeline:**

**Budget/Resources Available:**

**Must-have requirements:**
The catalog and inventory system must make the data and the metadata searchable.

**Nice-to-have preferences:**
Use of AI to help with searching and use of AI for future needs like automating the discovery and input of new catalog items.

**Cannot do/Off limits:**

## Current Attempts & Status
**What have you already tried?**

**What worked partially?**

**What failed and why?**
One of the issues the organization faces is accidental siloing of sub-groups within the organization so having a strategy or mechanism or feature that helps keep users informed of new items and data in the catalog would be useful.

## Success Criteria
**Primary goal:** A searchable data catalog that makes data easy to find and possibly download and makes it easy to get metadata about new data sources into the catalog.

**How will you measure success?**
One metric of success will be keeping a count of the number of users that use the system over time.  Another metric of success will be tracking the number of queries the system processes.

**Secondary benefits hoped for:**
Minimization of data siloing.
